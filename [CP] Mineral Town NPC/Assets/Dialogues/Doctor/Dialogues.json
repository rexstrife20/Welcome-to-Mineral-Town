I'll let you ponder that for yourself.$h",
                "Tue": "Be sure to be careful when farming. And mining. Honestly, you should be careful with everything your line of work includes.",

                "Fri": "Harvey over in Pelican Town is a very promising young physician. He needs to work on his posture a bit though. Slouching like that does no favors for the back.#$b#At this rate, he'll need to partner with a physical therapist just to keep himself going.",
                "Sat": "The weekends are usually more relaxed. Unfortunately, I'm on call to handle anyâ€¦.inebriation-based injuries.",

                "Sat2": "There aren't many medical facilities here in The Valleys.#$b$It's actually quite surprising myself and Harvey both have separate clinics so close to one another.",
                "Sun2": "People are much more relaxed on Sundays. I prefer it that way. The more they stay out of trouble, the more of a breather I can finally take.$h",
