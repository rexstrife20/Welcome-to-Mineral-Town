                "Mon": "The weekend is over. Time once again to work our hardest in the light of the Goddess. With that, I suppose I'd best be off!",
                "Tue": "Tales tell of small creatures known as Harvest Sprites that carry messages of the Goddess. Whether they are true or simply metaphorical, who can say for certain?",
                "Wed": "Hello there @. A fine day we're having today, is it not? Always important to remember to be grateful for days such as this.#$b#I'm sure that, as a farmer, you know this better than even I do!$h",
                "Thu": "Good day @. If you see Stu and Mei today, please ensure that that boy isn't dragging them into trouble once again. Not only would I appreciate it, but I'm sure it would put Ellen and Barleys minds to rest as well.",

                "Sat": "On Saturdays Stu and Mei come to help setup the church for service on Sunday. It's a pleasure to see kids with a strong work ethic these days.",
                "Sun": "Don't forget to give your thanks today. Whether it be to the Goddess or Yoba, it's important that we humble ourselves on occasion to keep us on the right path.",

                "fall_26": "I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Marlon bringing actual monsters in as attractions for the Spirit's Eve festival.$s#$b#Doesn't it just seem a bit excessive?", // Day before Spirit's Eve
                "winter_7": "I'm not usually one to attend the Ice Festival. It's nice to see everyone when I can, but that's a long walk to watch others ice fish and ice sculpt.", // Day before the Ice Festival

                //2 Heart
                "Mon2": "Shall I tell you why I do so little spiritual outreach in this town? Because the townspeople live according to the Goddess' teachings without even realizing it. There is nothing for me to teach.",

                "Sat2": "I like to think of the doctor as a sort of companion here in this valley. For, to truly be able to consider oneself \"healthy\", one must be balanced in both body and soul.#$b#One simply cannot thrive without the other.",
                "Sun2": "Ah, perfect timing. Might you stay long enough to listen to a parable of mine? I'll warn you--it may get a little long.#$e#Once upon a time, in a land not unlike our own, there was a normal family. The kind one would find anywhere. A father, mother, and their juvenile son all lived together in blissful harmony.#$b#One day, the mother succumbed to a virulent illness and suddenly passed away.$s#$b#As the grief stricken father stood over this late wife, the little boy came up to him and asked: \"What happened to Mom?\" The boy curiously peered at his dearly departed mother's unblinking face.#$b#The father, unsure what to say, desperately explained that she had fallen into a deep sleep.#$b#Upon hearing that, the boy was greatly troubled.$s#$b#He told his father: \"Then please, Dad. Use all of my allowance and buy a big alarm clock to wake her up.\"#$b#What do you think of that, @?#$b#That was when the father learned that the diluted words adult use to avoid speaking of death...hold neither power over nor meaning to children.#$b#Think on that. I bid you a blessed day$h.",

                "Wed4": "When I first came to Mineral Town, my predecessor asked me \"What would you say is the reason that the church exists?\".#$b#I still ponder that question to this day. The answer seems so obvious that it simply cannot be the first that comes to mind.",
                "Thu4": "Sometimes, I think that there are simply things that we are better off not knowing.#$b#Wouldn't you agree, @?",
                "Fri4": "Don't take this the wrong way, but there's something about Lillia's presence that is oddly soothing.#$b#Perhaps it is simply her kind spirit, but I cannot help but wonderâ€¦.",
                "Sat4": "What exactly IS a Junimo, I wonder.#$b#The Harvest Sprites have made themselves known in this valley, although subtly, for years now.#$b#Yet these Junimo seemed to have only appeared much more recently. It's quite intriguing, don't you agree?",

                "Wed8": "That Cliff is a poor lost soul. But he seems to be doing better as of late. I'm glad our services here have taken a load off of his heart.",

                "Fri8": "Do you know what I've always wanted to try? Hangliding!$h#$b#Something about it look so freeing for mind and body.#$b#If ever the opportunity arises, I'll be sure to extend an invitation.$h",
                "Sat8": "There's a strange force that emanates from Cindersap Forest. Something not quite human, yet not malicious per se.#$b#Have you experienced anything similar?",
                "Sun8": "There's something special about this valley, wouldn't you agree?#$b#The pull to come settle my roots here was far too strong to simply have been happenstance.",
                //10 Heart

                "Fri10": "We've started a fund to help Linus find more permanent residence.#$b#Nobody should have to experience need as he does on a daily basis.#$b#Come to think of it, there's a man in Forget-Me-Not Valley in much of the same predicament.",
                "Sat10": "If there's one thing I truly want, it's for the people of Mineral Town to be well and live prosperous lives.#$b#I'm beginning to think that your arrival might be a part of the answers to my prayers.$h",
