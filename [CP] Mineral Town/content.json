Rabbits and squirrels and even foxes live there.^^People say that monkeys sometimes share the hot spring with the people of the village.^^^\"Creatures of the Mountain - 2 - Mountain Insects\"^^Many kinds of insects live in the mountain near my village. Cicadas, crickets, grasshoppers, ladybugs, bees, and even rare insects like the Atlas beetle and the Stag beetle can be found there.^^^\"Creatures of the Mountain - 3 - Problems for the Villagers\"^^Like I wrote before, many different animals live in the mountain near my village. There are animals like foxes, but nothing dangerous like bears or wild bear.^^However, wild dogs live on the mountain and these sometimes come down and attack livestock, which is a problem for the farmers.^^^^Written by^Basil",
        "MT.Library.3": "\"The 7 Brothers That Live in the Forest - 1\"^^A long time ago, there were 7 little brothers who lived all apart from each other. The brothers were not very friendly with the villagers because they were small and the villagers seemed big and scary.^^Each brother had a different favourite color and liked a different favourite thing, so they figured they would always live apart.^^^\"The 7 Brothers That Live in the Forest - 2\"^^One day Chef, whose favourite color is red and who likes to cook, realized he had a problem. \"I love to cook, but there's nobody to eat my delicious food...\"^^Hoggy, whose favourite color is yellow and who loves to sleep, also had a problem. \"I love to sleep so much I don't want to get up and cook, but then I just get hungrier and hungrier.\"^^^\"The 7 Brothers That Live in the Forest - 3\"^^You can hear the sound, Hoo Hooooo, at night. Something sparks in the darkness. \"Ahhhh!\" Shiver-shiver-shiver... Timid likes the color green because it's easy for him to hide in the forest. But even then he's scared.^^You can hear the sound, Hoo Hooooo, at night. Something sparks in the darkness. \"Hai, Yaaaa!\" Crumble-crumble-crumble... Bold loves purple because he can hide in the shadows and use his battle cry \"Hai, Yaaaa!\" to defeat large enemies.^^^\"The 7 Brothers That Live in the Forest - 4\"^^Stylish Aqua loves the color light blue. \"Sigh... I'm running out of provisions fast. I like being stylish, but when I work I don't have the time...\"^^\"Ughhh... That's as much as I can do... Ahh!\" Staid is very serious and a hard worker. He likes the color blue and everything he wears is blue, so he is easy to spot.^^\"Staid,\" said Aqua, \" let's live together. It's got to be better than living alone.\"^^\"Aqua,\" said Staid, \" what brings you here, and with a story like that?\"^^\"Well you see,\" said Aqua, \"whisper...whisper...shisper...\"^^^\"The 7 Brothers That Live in the Forest - 5\"^^\"Ha ha ha, so that's it,\" said Staid. \" Sure, let's live together. But what's the point of everything being clean if you're still hungry?\"^^\"Even when your stomach is full, your heart remains hungry if things are not clean,\" replied Aqua.^^\"OK, so you do the chores like the cleaning and laundry.\"^^\"So, all I have to do is eat?\", asked Hoggy. \"Yes, all you have to do is eat. I enjoy watching you eat my food and being told it is delicious,\" replied Chef. \"I don't understand, but that's fine by me.\"^^\"Ha ha ha, what a mess you are,\" laughed Bold. \"Oh, it's you Bold,\" squeaked Timid.^^\"Who did you think I was?\" \"I don't know, but I'm scared of everything in the forest.\"^^\"Well then, you should stay with me. I'm not afraid of anything.\" \"OK, if that's what we do...\"^^\"If we're going to live together...\" \"We'll need a bigger house...\" \"Let's leave the forest for a bit...\"^^^\"The 7 Brothers That Live in the Forest - 6\"^^So Chef & Hoggy, Staid & Aqua, and Timid & Bold all decided to leave the forest for a while. The first one to find the house was Staid.^^\"Hey I found a house that's just right for us.\" \"Yes, it's a lot smaller than a human house, but it's just the right size for us.\"^^\"But there's a light on inside.\" \"Let's go in.\" \"Hey, wait... Aqua\"^^...CRASH!! \"Oh...\"^^^\"The 7 Brothers That Live in the Forest - 7\"^^\"Hello brother, long time no see.\" There in the house was the youngest brother, Nappy.^^\"Oh, it's you Nappy. You surprised me. How did you get this house?\" \"The people of the village built it for me.\"^^\"What?\" \"I always thought there'd be a time when we would all live together, so I had them make 7 beds.\"^^\"What made you think that?\" \"Because look, all of you are here.\"^^\"What?\" When Staid and Aqua turned around, they saw the rest of their brothers walking toward the house.^^^^Written by^Anonymous",
        "MT.Library.4": "\"Mountain Harvest - Seasons\"^^In the Spring, you can gather bamboo shoots in the bamboo forest near the hot springs on the mountain.^^Like the hot spring, the bamboo forest is public property so anyone can harvest there.^^^^Written by^Basil",
        "MT.Library.5": "\"Village Festivals - 1 - The Local Horse Race\"^^This village holds a local horse race on 18th day of Spring where horses from the farms of a number of villages come together for a race.^^The farmers normally use their horses for farm work, but as the race day nears they spend time training their horses for the race.^^Once I asked a nearby farmer if there was anything special one could do to win...^\"I don't do anything special, just brush my horse and talk to it everyday.\"^\"Actually, it is better practice for the horse to get on him and run, but... my leg.\"^^That was his answer.^^^^^\"Village Festivals - 2 - Opening Day\"^^This village holds an opening day ocean festival on the 1st day of Summer.^^In this festival, young men participate in a swim race. There appear to be no particular rules, but the \"thrash\" seems to be the most popular swim style.^^Swimming in the ocean is hard work, so the men are all very serious. This ocean race is quite difficult, and you must take many small breaths or you will tire and have difficulty reaching the finishing line.^^My friend the swimmer says: \"It is better to take short small breaths when long-distance swimming.\" But for us amateurs, it is hard to keep pace even over short distances.^^It is better not to wait until you can't hold your breath any longer. It is not good for your body to hold your breath for so long.^^^\"Village Festivals - 3 - The Chicken Festival\"^^This village holds a Chicken Festival on the 7th day of Summer and many people from nearby villages come to participate in the chicken sumo.^^The fights take place in a circle, with two chickens trying to intimidate each other out of the ring.^^I talked with the host of the chicken sumo, himself a poultry farmer...^\"People don't train special birds for the contest, but they do tend to select the chicken they feel most strongly about.\"^^\"Such chickens want to do their best and impress their owner, so they'll try their hardest. Some don't even need any urging.\"^^\"But if the owner is not paying enough attention, their chicken might flee out of the ring at the first fright.\" \"...I guess it all comes down to the relationship between man and hen (laugh)\"^^This is what the referee said. The thing that motivates the chicken most is probably the \"Love\" it has received from its owner.^^^\"Village Festivals - 4 - The Tomato Festival\"^^This village holds a Tomato Festival on the 12th day of Summer to celebrate the tomato harvest.^^What the villagers do is have a big food fight with the tomatoes. Most of the villagers participate in this festival, forming teams of 3 people each. It is a festival enjoyed by people of all ages.^^The men can throw faster than the women and children, but in the end it all comes down to how well you can dodge the tomatoes.^^^^\"Village Festivals - 5 - The Dog Race\"^^This village holds a Dog Race on the 10th day of Winter.^^In this race, the owners run as fast as they can and try to get their dogs to follow them to reach the goal first.^^The sight of the dog owners trying so hard to get their dogs to follow them sparks much laughter from the crowd. The interesting part of this race is that it clearly reveals the relationship between dog and owner.^^Dogs that are trained try very hard to keep up with their owners so they can stay close. If a dog has not been trained properly, when it tires and can't keep up it will wander away and forget about the race.^^I asked the host of the dog race whether he had any hints for winning...^\"It's simple. The owner just has to run at the pace of the dog.\"^^That was his answer. I guess that's all there is to it.^^^^Written by^Basil",
        "MT.Library.6": "\"Flowers - 1 - Mountain Flowers\"^^The mountain I always hike has many different kinds of flowers blooming, depending on the season.^^The most common flower in this village is the Moon Drop. In the spring, some places are completely covered in these yellow flowers.^^In the fall, a flower called the Magic Red blooms. The flowers are normally blue, but sometimes the blossoms are red. The villagers here use the flower for medicine.^^Why these plants sometimes bloom red flowers is a mystery.^^^\"Flowers - 2 - The Flower of Happiness\"^^In the winter, when the mountain is covered in snow, some people claim to have seen a white flower blooming. The villagers call this the \"Flower of Happiness\", saying those who view it are blessed with happiness.^^Other countries have similar stories, and because they are all snowy countries, it is thought to be the same flower.^^^Written by^Basil",
